<h1>The Big Blue Planet</h1>

 Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun in our solar system. 
 Neptune is a fascinating and mysterious world, and it continues to be the subject of scientific 
 interest and study, even though it remains largely unexplored compared to some of the other planets in our solar system.
 Neptune is an extremely cold planet, with temperatures plummeting to around -360°F (-218°C) 
 in its upper atmosphere. The extreme cold and high-speed winds make it one of the harshest environments in the solar system.
 Neptune has a substantial number of moons, with the most famous being Triton. 
 Triton is unique among large moons in the solar system because it orbits Neptune in a retrograde direction
  (opposite to the planet's rotation), suggesting that it may have been captured from the Kuiper Belt or another source.
<br>
Neptune's unique characteristics, including its dynamic atmosphere, intriguing moon Triton, and 
enigmatic rings, make it a captivating object of study in the solar system. Despite its remoteness, our 
understanding of this distant ice giant continues to expand as new discoveries are made through astronomical observations and research.

    <h1> <center>Fun Facts about Neptune</center></h1>

<ol>
<li> Neptune is located at an average distance of about 2.8 billion miles
   (4.5 billion kilometers) from the Sun. It is the outermost of the major planets in our solar system.</li>

<li> Neptune is known for its extremely turbulent and dynamic atmosphere. It features a prominent dark storm system called the "Great Dark Spot," which is similar in 
  appearance to Jupiter's Great Red Spot. This storm system can vary in size and intensity and is accompanied by high-speed winds.</li>

<li>Neptune has been visited by only one spacecraft to date, Voyager 2, which flew by the planet in 1989. The limited data from this flyby has 
  provided valuable insights into the planet's characteristics.</li>

<li>Neptune is the fourth-largest planet by diameter and the third-largest by mass. It has a diameter of
   approximately 30,000 miles (49,244 kilometers) and a mass 17 times that of Earth.</li>
